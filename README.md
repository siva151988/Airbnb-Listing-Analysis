### Data Cleaning Insights
- **Missing Values:**  
  - Some listings have missing values.These missing review data points were handled by either imputing with zero (assuming no reviews) or filtering out during analysis based on the context.

- **Date Formatting:**  
  - The columns `host_since` were initially stored as strings and needed conversion to datetime format to allow time series and duration analysis.
    
- **Outlier Detection:**  
  - Price data contained extreme outliers with very high nightly prices. These were flagged for further investigation or removal to avoid skewing analysis.

### üìà EDA Insights
- **Listings Distribution**:  
  - Certain neighborhoods had a higher density of listings, indicating popular tourist zones.

- **Room Type Trends**:  
  - Entire homes dominate the market, followed by private rooms.
   
- **Decline in New Hosts After 2015**  
  A significant drop in the number of new hosts was observed starting in 2015. This suggests that regulatory measures (such as zoning laws, host registration, or tax enforcement) may have discouraged new entries into the short-term rental market.

## üîç Key Highlights
